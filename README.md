# Advent-of-Code-2023
This is the first year I'm taking part in advent of code. 

I chose to use C++ because I wanted to practise my skills, explore the language and improve my algorithm solving skills.

⛔️ No Artificial Intelligence allowed to solve the puzzles 🙂

⚠️ Some puzzles resolutions may not be optimal in terms of clarity, efficiency, and adherence ⚠️

[hadn't much time to review and optimize all the puzzles]
