# Advent-of-Code-2023
This is the first year I'm taking part in advent of code. 

I chose to use C++ because I wanted to practise my skills, explore the language and improve my algorithm solving skills.

⛔️ No Artificial Intelligence allowed to solve the puzzles 🙂

⚠️ The puzzles code may not be optimal in terms of clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices [had no time to review and optimize]
